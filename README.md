## About the Video Course
Blockchain is a revolution promising a new world without middlemen. This course will provide you with all the relevant concepts related to cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and blockchain in order to build your own decentralized applications.
You will begin with the development of a basic application using Blockchain and mining blocks. Moving further, you will build the Bitcoin codebase and you will be able to build your own currency/tamper-proof DB. Using Hyperledger you will implement various blockchains to create a supply chain application. You will explore ERC20 standards to create an ERC20 smart contract and you will also learn to improve its standards with ERC22 to develop its first ICO. Lastly, you will create a gambling application using ETH network smart contracts. Each project will teach you just enough about blockchain to be productive right away.
By the end of this course, you will not only be able to tackle common issues in the blockchain ecosystem but you'll also design and build reliable, scalable, distributed systems.
